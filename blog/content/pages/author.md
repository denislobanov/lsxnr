</br>

By day I am a software engineer working over at [Thought
Machine](https://thoughtmachine.net/) but by night, I am also a software
engineer - albeit a sleepy one.

<!--more-->
I am also rider of motorbikes and a maker of music (the last one is debatable).
This blog is something that I started as a sort of `/dev/null` for my thoughts,
and somewhere to store some notes so I can figure out how I ever managed to hack
that thing together!

[GitHub](https://github.com/denislobanov)  
For most of my public stuff.

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/denislobanov)  
Maybe.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lobanovdenis)  
Is where you can find that exact same description but with some CV credentials.

[last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/movsb)  
Is where you can go to find my music tastes and listening habits (I saved the
best till last).
