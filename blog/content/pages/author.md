By day I am a software engineer working on the data team over at [last.fm](https://last.fm) but by night, I am also a software engineer - albeit a sleepy one.

I am also rider of motorbikes and a maker of music (the last one is debatable). This blog is something that I started as a sort of `/dev/null` for my thoughs, and somewhere to store some notes so I can figure out how I ever managed to hack that thing together!
